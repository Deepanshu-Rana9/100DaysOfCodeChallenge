 🚀 100 Days of Code: Data Science Foundations  

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** challenge! This repository documents my daily progress as I strengthen my **Python for Data Science** skills, focusing on **Python basics, essential libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**—without diving into Machine Learning or Deep Learning.  

---

 📅 Challenge Roadmap  

 ✅ **Week 1-2: Python Basics (Days 1-14)**  
Covers fundamental Python concepts such as loops, functions, data structures, string manipulations, and basic problem-solving techniques.  

 ✅ **Week 3-4: NumPy (Days 15-28)**  
Focuses on array operations, matrix manipulations, statistical computations, broadcasting, and performance optimization using NumPy.  

 ✅ **Week 5-6: Pandas (Days 29-42)**  
Introduces data handling with Pandas, including DataFrame operations, data cleaning, aggregation, merging, filtering, and transformation.  

 ✅ **Week 7-8: Data Visualization (Days 43-56)**  
Explores data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn, covering different types of plots, customization, and aesthetic enhancements.  

 ✅ **Week 9-10: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Days 57-70)**  
Dives into techniques for understanding data, identifying patterns, handling missing values, detecting outliers, and feature scaling.  

 ✅ **Week 11-12: Advanced EDA & Feature Engineering (Days 71-84)**  
Covers more advanced EDA techniques, feature engineering strategies, handling categorical data, and working with time series data.  

 ✅ **Week 13-14: Real-World Mini Projects (Days 85-100)**  
Applies all learned concepts to real-world datasets, performing in-depth EDA on various domains such as finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and more.
